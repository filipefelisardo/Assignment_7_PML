# Assignment_7_PML

Code based on the work of Emre Aslan

Assignment description:
-Read carefully the notebook corn leaf disease which classifies with high precision images of corn leaves into 4 classes: Blight, Common_Rust, Gray_Leaf_Spot and Healthy;
-Implement that code or some similar code either on Colab or on your own machine and compare the your results with the results reported in the notebook for the same corn diseases data set; If you're not able to run it on GPU on Colab, you might try to run it on CPU on your own laptop/desktop for a few epochs;
-You need to include an instruction in your code to save the model like torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model.pth") in the notebook above (or you can save it in a different format like the pickle format with extension .pkl), so the trained model can be re-used later;
